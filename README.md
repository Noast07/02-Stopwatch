# Stopwatch Website - Challenge 02
---
Why did I create this project? This is the first project I created on GitHUB showcasing the skills I learned utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript

What was my motivation? This is the beginning of a complicated project - first I want create HTML, CSS, and Javascript (client) and in the future I will tie it in with Flask (framework) and use Python (language). I want to create a more complex website by utilizing a massive analytics dashboard, which explains my route of combining multiple technologies.

Why did I build this project? To test my abilities and see what I am able to create utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

What problem does it solve? This solution is just a simple stopwatch app within a browser. No fluff or anything else.

What did I learn from this project? I learned how to implement and calculate more functions within Javascript. Such as figuring out how to create a simple set of code tasked to create my stopwatch.
